# Emoji-Rebus

**Rebus Puzzle** - A rebus (/ˈriːbəs/) is a puzzle device which combines the use of illustrated pictures 
with individual letters to depict words and/or phrases. For example: the word ‘been’ might be depicted by 
a "rebus" showing an illustrated bumblebee next to a plus sign (+) and the letter "n". It was a favorite 
form of heraldic expression used in the Middle Ages to denote surnames. - [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebus)

In this game, rebus puzzles are built with emojis!

Have fun! Cheers
